                <p>Technology is the study of scientific knowledge in order to create tools and processes that may be
                    used to change the world by increasing efficiency in nearly every aspect of our lives. Technology
                    has impacted our lives positively and allowed ideas and resources to be shared more easily, the
                    overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social division,

                <h3> Positive Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:</h3>

                <h3>AI Changing The Way We Work</h3>
                <p>AI algorithms have the potential to revolutionize decision-making processes by analyzing vast amounts
                    of
                    data, identifying patterns, and providing valuable insights.The AI revolution really is here.
                    ChatGPT
                    has been helping people with jobs like writing recipes, creating job resumes, crafting essays and
                    poems,
                    summarizing historical events, composing emails, creating spreadsheets, and even filing their tax
                    returns.</p>

                <h3>Better Information Access</h3>
                <p>With just a few clicks, you can get access to loads of information. Because of this, we have more
                    freedom
                    and we can deliver our work from almost any part of the world. Technology makes sharing files,
                    studying,
                    and more much easier.The internet and digital tools allows to explore various subjects, conduct
                    research, and access educational materials that may not be available in traditional textbooks.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Social Lives</h3>
                <p>Another seismic change in our lives over the past decade has been the widespread usage of social
                    media.
                    Services such as Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, and others give us an insight into the waking
                    lives of others in real-time, whether they're friends with a few followers or celebrities with
                    millions.
                </p>

                <br><br><br>

                <h3> Negative Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Isolation</li>
                    <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Physical health effects</li>
                    <li>Anti-Socialization</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Isolation</h3>
                <p> Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the
                    opposite effect in some cases.

                    A 2017study in young adults aged 19 to 32 years found that people with higher social media use were
                    more than three times as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as
                    often.

                    Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help
                    reduce feelings of isolation in some people.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Depression and anxiety</h3>
                <p>The authors of a 2016 systematic reviewTrusted Source discussed the link between social networks and
                    mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.

                    Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions and social support on
                    these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety.

                    However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social
                    interactions online and who were more prone to social comparison experienced higher levels of
                    depression and anxiety.

                    So, while there does appear to be a link between social media and mental health, a significant
                    determining factor is the types of interactions people feel they are having on these platforms.</p>

                <h3>Physical health effects</h3>
                <p>With just a few clicks, you can get access to loads of information. Because of this, we have more
                    freedom
                    and we can deliver our work from almost any part of the world. Technology makes sharing files,
                    studying,

            <div class="article">

                <br><br><br>

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <br>

                <img src="../images/blog_images/html-img.webp" alt="" height="200px">

                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
                    HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web
                    pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the
                    structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that
                    a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are
                    human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
                </p>

                <p> HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content.
                    Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag
                    until the end of the page.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="article">

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <br>

                <img src="../images/blog_images/css.webp" alt="" height="200px">

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify
                    the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
                    importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It
                    describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short,
                    you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it
                    behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
                </p>

                <p> While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides
                    powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="article">

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <br>

                <img src="../images/blog_images/js.png" height="200px" alt="">

                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming
                    language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the
                    development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
                </p>

                <p> JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side
                    developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative
                    type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and
                    a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
