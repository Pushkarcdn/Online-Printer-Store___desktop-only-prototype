                <h3> Positive Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved Communication</li>

                    the overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social

                <h3>AI Changing The Way We Work</h3>
                <p>AI algorithms have the potential to revolutionize decision-making processes by analyzing vast amounts
                    of
                    data, identifying patterns, and providing valuable insights.The AI revolution really is here.
                    ChatGPT
                    has been helping people with jobs like writing recipes, creating job resumes, crafting essays and
                    poems,
                    summarizing historical events, composing emails, creating spreadsheets, and even filing their tax
                    returns.</p>

                <h3>Better Information Access</h3>
                <p>With just a few clicks, you can get access to loads of information. Because of this, we have more
                    freedom
                    and we can deliver our work from almost any part of the world. Technology makes sharing files,
                    studying,
                    and more much easier.The internet and digital tools allows to explore various subjects, conduct
                    research, and access educational materials that may not be available in traditional textbooks.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Social Lives</h3>
                <p>Another seismic change in our lives over the past decade has been the widespread usage of social
                    media.
                    Services such as Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, and others give us an insight into the waking
                    lives of others in real-time, whether they're friends with a few followers or celebrities with
                    millions.
                </p>

                <br><br><br>

                <h3> Negative Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Isolation</li>
                    <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Physical health effects</li>
                    <li>Anti-Socialization</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Isolation</h3>
                <p> Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the
                    opposite effect in some cases.

                    A 2017study in young adults aged 19â€“32 years found that people with higher social media use were
                    more than three times as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as
                    often.

                    Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help
                    reduce feelings of isolation in some people.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Depression and anxiety</h3>
                <p>The authors of a 2016 systematic reviewTrusted Source discussed the link between social networks and
                    mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.

                    Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions and social support on
                    these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety.

                    However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social
                    interactions online and who were more prone to social comparison experienced higher levels of
                    depression and anxiety.

                    So, while there does appear to be a link between social media and mental health, a significant
                    determining factor is the types of interactions people feel they are having on these platforms.</p>

                <h3>Physical health effects</h3>
                <p>With just a few clicks, you can get access to loads of information. Because of this, we have more
                    freedom
                    and we can deliver our work from almost any part of the world. Technology makes sharing files,
                    studying,
